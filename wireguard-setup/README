`client.list` contains the list of public keys that are authorized to use
the VPN tunnel.

`eq908-client.tmpl` is the wireguard VPN tunnel configuration template file
used by `./genclientconf` to produce a plug-and-play client configuration file.
Either import configuration via QR code, or use conventional file transfer methods.

`*.key.gpg` is the encrypted private key for the VPN tunnel gateway.
Hack this, and you gain full control over the entire VPN (maybe).

`./genclientconf` takes a ${NAME} as its $1 argument and outputs `clients/${NAME}.conf`.

`./genserverconf` consumes `client.list` to produce a server-specific wireguard VPN
configuration file that can also be plug-and-play.

Networking Changes:
```
PostUp = iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -I 1 FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

The forwarding chain rules are added because the assumption is made that the default policy for the FORWARD chain is DROP.
Applied both times, one for %i (incoming); one for %i (outgoing).
Often shared configurations in the internet leave out the necessary configuration for %i (outgoing) which causes issues.
